 * Brian's brain cellular automata rule
 * Universe: 2D grid, cells have 8 neighbors
 * A cell turns on if it was off but had exactly two neighbors that were on.
 * All cells that were "on" go into the "dying" state, which is not counted as an "on" cell in the neighbor count, and prevents any cell from being born there.
 * Cells that were in the dying state go into the off state.
