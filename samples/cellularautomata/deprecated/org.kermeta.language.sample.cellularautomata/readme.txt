possible extension, addition

add something to initiate the initial state on the grid ?
add a way to reuse rules with several geometry ? (ie. a kind of rule library)

Possible refactoring applicable on this system :
	- change the topology of a CA_VM Grid
	- change a big Conditional into several more readable rules  


have several rule filtered on a value range:
	so we can split one big rule with a big conditional into several more readable rules.
	useful for modelisint a chessboard and piece move
	
	allow some refactoring
